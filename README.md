# examples
Showing examples of other public projects in use.

This project showcases: healthcheckioapi, secproj and felog.

These libraries/projects are a portion of a suite of tools used to simply and quickly deploy
larger scale code without the hassle of having to write a ton of boiler-plate code each time.


TODO: As more projects become available, I will add modules here to show them in use.

NOTE: I was considering also having some sort of plugin system implemented, this would bring 
the whole suite to a more robust and comfrotable working base for most large project needs.
